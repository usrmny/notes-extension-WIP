I will create folders for my files once I finish what's left to do. (This will also become an actual guide on how to the project).

The only part ready to be seen is the actual notes page (not the menu page). If you're interested in checking that out, you must download these files and keep them in the same folder:
- miniNotes.html
- styles.css
- miniNotesRevamp.js

TODO:
- each note must connect to a new miniNotes.html page (node.js)
- use the notion api to read deadlines from notion and inscribe them in notes on request by user
- additional subtask for each subtask created (optional)
- more keybinds??? (maybe/ not sure if its needed)
