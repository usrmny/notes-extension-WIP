Current Functionalities:
- Add, edit and delete Items
- Move items around. (click {gear icon > keybinds} to see how)
- Checking items when done

Working On / TODO:

I will create folders for my files once I finish what's left to do.

If you're interested in trying this project out, download the following files:

- miniNotes.html
- styles.css
- miniNotesRevamp.js

NOTE: All the files in the "archive" folder can be ignored.
